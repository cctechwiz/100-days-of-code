# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 27, 2020
##### Setup and Planning

**Today's Progress**:
* Publicly commit to doing 100 days of code on Twitter.
* Created a blog site using gatsby and hosting on netlify. (still waiting for DNS to propagate...)

**Thoughts:** I hate just copying things by using starters, but I figured this time I needed to just get started instead of trying to start by learning everything from scratch. I can always come back and customize / advance things in the future after I've already begun.
