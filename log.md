# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 27, 2020
##### Setup and Planning

**Today's Progress**:
* Publicly commit to doing 100 days of code on Twitter.
* Created a blog site using gatsby and hosting on netlify. (still waiting for DNS to propagate...)

**Thoughts:** I hate just copying things by using starters, but I figured this time I needed to just get started instead of trying to start by learning everything from scratch. I can always come back and customize / advance things in the future after I've already begun.

### Day 1: May 28, 2020
##### Configuring and modifying my blog site

**Today's Progress**: I configured and modified the starte blog I created yesterday. Learning the structure and how this thing works.

**Thoughts:** There is a lot that is involved with the starter blog and I'm not familiar with React yet so it was a bit overwhelming. That's ok, one step at a time, this time...

### Day 2: May 29, 2020
##### Personal URL Shortner / Aliases

**Today's Progress**: Created a personal url shortener to give redirectable aliases to urls. I plan to use this on my blog and other sites where a url might change, or I just want a shortened version. Primary shortener link is cctw.link but link.cctechwiz.com also works.

**Thoughts:** Pretty simple to setup using Netlify and GitHub.

### Day 3: May 30, 2020
##### Hands on Training for OWASP ZAP

**Today's Progress**: I played with OWASP ZAP today using a new Coursera guided project.

**Thoughts:** I was OK, nothing too special though. Fun to learn a new tool though.

### Day 4: June 1, 2020
##### Getting Started with Xamarin.iOS

**Today's Progress**: I created a starter app with Xamarin.iOS. I got stuck because I don't own a mac and don't have money in the budget this month to pay for a MacinCloud instance. Also, my iPhone USB port is broken, so I'll have to use the Simulate iPhone for testing rather than my own for now.

**Thoughts:** Seems promising, but I'll need to figure out access to a mac and iPhone... I guess this plann was not very well thought out.

### Day 5: June 2, 2020
##### Jessica's Recipe App Design

**Today's Progress**: Picked back up on a project I started a while ago to build a web app for my wife to use as a recipe book. Mostly just reading and re-familiarizing myself with the project status. Some additional design and planning work as well.

**Thoughts:** I'm going to continue to try for vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS for this site so I can make myself learn the basics of web dev from the bottom up.

**Link to work:** [Test Site](https://github.com/cctechwiz/vanilla_site) Note: This link will change once this idea is validated and starts becoming the actual web app instead of a prototype.
