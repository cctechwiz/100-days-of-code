# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 27, 2020
##### Setup and Planning

**Today's Progress**:
* Publicly commit to doing 100 days of code on Twitter.
* Created a blog site using gatsby and hosting on netlify. (still waiting for DNS to propagate...)

**Thoughts:** I hate just copying things by using starters, but I figured this time I needed to just get started instead of trying to start by learning everything from scratch. I can always come back and customize / advance things in the future after I've already begun.

### Day 1: May 28, 2020
##### Configuring and modifying my blog site

**Today's Progress**: I configured and modified the starte blog I created yesterday. Learning the structure and how this thing works.

**Thoughts:** There is a lot that is involved with the starter blog and I'm not familiar with React yet so it was a bit overwhelming. That's ok, one step at a time, this time...

### Day 2: May 29, 2020
##### Personal URL Shortner / Aliases

**Today's Progress**: Created a personal url shortener to give redirectable aliases to urls. I plan to use this on my blog and other sites where a url might change, or I just want a shortened version.

**Thoughts:** Pretty simple to setup using Netlify and GitHub.
