### Day 1: June 13, 2020
##### Netlify Identity + protected Functions

**Today's Progress**: I started over my days today since it had been over a week since I last did coding outside of work. Today I figured out Netlify Identity and used that to make a protected serverless Function.

**Thoughts:** Very cool that I am able to authenticate and make secure calls to an api without running my own server. :D

### Day 2: June 15, 2020
##### Started Permafrost: Slide Puzzle Game

**Today's Progress**: I started making a game I thought of recently. It's going to be a puzzle game where you slide the little character to turn all the grass squares into ice squares. So far I've go the TileMap grid working.

**Thoughts:** Fun, I like making games with Godot.

[2/100] Started my next #GameDev project `Permafrost: Slide Puzzle` using #GodotEngine. The objective is to slide over all the grass and freeze it w/o getting stuck. Got the placeholder assets made in #Aseprite and the TileMap setup in Godot. Repo: https://github.com/lone-llama-workshop/Permafrost-Slide-Puzzle

### Day 3: June 16, 2020
##### Home page listing and linking recipes

**Today's Progress**: Rename project to Simmerdown! I got the home page to list all recipes with links to their respective view page. Also some general refactoring and house keeping.

**Thoughts:** Pretty good progress today, now I can move on to the skeleton of the edit page.
