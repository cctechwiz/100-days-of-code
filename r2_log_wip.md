### Day 1: June 13, 2020
##### Netlify Identity + protected Functions

**Today's Progress**: I started over my days today since it had been over a week since I last did coding outside of work. Today I figured out Netlify Identity and used that to make a protected serverless Function.

**Thoughts:** Very cool that I am able to authenticate and make secure calls to an api without running my own server. :D

### Day 2: June 15, 2020
##### Started Permafrost: Slide Puzzle Game

**Today's Progress**: I started making a game I thought of recently. It's going to be a puzzle game where you slide the little character to turn all the grass squares into ice squares. So far I've go the TileMap grid working.

**Thoughts:** Fun, I like making games with Godot.
