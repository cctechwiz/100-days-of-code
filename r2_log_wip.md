### Day 1: June 13, 2020
##### Netlify Identity + protected Functions

**Today's Progress**: I started over my days today since it had been over a week since I last did coding outside of work. Today I figured out Netlify Identity and used that to make a protected serverless Function.

**Thoughts:** Very cool that I am able to authenticate and make secure calls to an api without running my own server. :D
